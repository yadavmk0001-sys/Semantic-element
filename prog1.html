        <h2>Facts about Dogs</h2>
        <p>Like humans, most dogs have a dominant hand – or in their case, paw! To figure out which one it is, you can
            conduct a
            simple science experiment…

            Watch a dog moving from standing still to walking forwards. Do they start walking with their left leg, or
            their right?
            Watch several times, noting down the starting leg each time, and see if there’s a pattern. Many dogs will
            often lead
            with the same leg – their dominant one!</p>
